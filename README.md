# Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict the price of cars based on various features using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and testing the model is provided in the `car_info.csv` file.

## Dataset
The dataset (`car_info.csv`) contains the following features:
- **Feature 1**: Description of feature 1.
- **Feature 2**: Description of feature 2.
- **Feature 3**: Description of feature 3.
- ...
- **Target**: Price of the car (the variable to be predicted).

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (if running the project interactively)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/car-price-prediction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd car-price-prediction
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Ensure you have installed all the required libraries.
2. Run the `car_price_prediction.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook or Python script.
3. Follow the instructions provided in the notebook/script to load the dataset, preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
4. You can also use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

## Results
Provide insights on the performance of the trained model, such as accuracy, error metrics, and any visualizations that help in understanding the predictions.
